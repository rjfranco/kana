# Kana

Kana is meant to help people learn the common Japanese syllabaries, Hiragana and Katakana. But I'd love to make it much more.
Eventually I'd love to see guides on things like kanji and radicals integrated into the app, and a much more comprehensive and organized vocabulary list.
What you see here is a first pass and I have some great ideas on how it could progress, but I'm totally open to what it should actually do.
